        <h1 style="font-family: Monospace">Rayan Dahbi's Screenprinting Project</h1>
        <h2 style="font-family: Monospace">My Exposition</h2>
        <p style="font-family: Monospace">Hello, my name is Rayan Dahbi, I am a 9th grade student at ESUMS. At ESUMS you take a class in 9th grade called “New Media and Technology”, in the second unit of the class you start a project called the screenprinting project, in this project you have to create a frame that has a image behind the screen of it, and then iron it onto the screen of the frame, and after that you paint it, and then start putting papers, cardboard, and fabric on the frame, spilling the paint on the paper. And after all that you would take pictures of all your artwork and submit it via Google Classroom.</p>


<h2 style="font-family: Monospace">The Start</h2>
<p style="font-family: Monospace">To start off, the Screen Printing process took a couple of months, basically from November until January. The First Step of the process was to plan out how the picture would turn out looking like.For me, i picked 1/60 shutter and 200 ISO,and I also used an insert frame. And then after that was actually taking a picture and using that to Photoshop the image. When you start photoshopping an image you need to open it and then have a clear canvas and put the image in there and after that start searching for your second image to create your full frame, also you would need to find out what type of brushes you had used, I used the default brush and I used 3 layers, the text, the photo, and the second photo from the web. So, after all the photoshop and picture-taking, you are done with the first step of the Screen Printing process. The Second step is the physical process, so we start cutting the wood on the saw to create the frame. After we cut all the wood we start piecing it together and gluing it together, and then after that we staple the screen onto the frame, and after that we start the real screen printing process which is basically when you open this application called Silhouette Studio, and then put your photoshopped png image and you'd have to put it correctly on the frame in Silhouette, and then sending it off to the screen printing machine. And after sending it off, it would print your image and then you put your image on the back of your screen printing frame.</p>

<h2 style="font-family: Monospace">The Climax</h2>
<p style="font-family: Monospace">Next, after putting your image on the back of your screen printing frame you would then iron it on, and after you had ironed it on you would check for spots, or any imperfections in the screen printing frame. After that, you’d start mixing paint to start painting, once you finished that you would then start putting paint on your frame and getting a ruler or thing to spread the paint out on the frame with and you would then start spreading the paint all around and after its all spread you would start getting papers and putting it on the bottom of the frame so the paint can go from the stencil/image to the paper below. After all that's done, you would then repeat the process with a cardboard box and fabric, and once you've finished everything like the cardboard box, fabric, papers, and the frame. Then you would be finished with the project, but after that you would need to get images, which you would have been taking throughout the whole process and submit it to google classroom.</p>

<h2 style="font-family: Monospace">The Conclusion</h2>
<p style="font-family: Monospace">In conclusion, the screenprinting project was a 2-3 month process of first photoshopping your frame, then getting your wood and cutting it, and after that gluing and stapling the wood, and then getting your screen and stapling it onto your frame, and then screen printing your image. And after all that is done, you would start ironing the image onto your frame, And from there you would then start painting your photoshopped image/stencil onto the frame. And then start placing papers, cardboard boxes and fabrics onto the bottom of the frame with paint. Finally, you would be finished with the physical process of the project. In summary, this project was nothing but fun and really helpful to learn about the screen printing process. I would definitely do this project again some other day if I could. But one of the most challenging things in the screenprinting project was photoshopping.</p>

<h2 style="font-family: Monospace">21st Century Competency</h2>
<p style="font-family: Monospace"> For this project, I used <strong>communication and collaboration</strong>, I demonstrated communication and colloboration by helping others during the project by taking photos for them, helping them with the photoshop process, and the physical process. So, I think i really used my 21st Century Competency terms well, because I helped others and collaborated with a lot of people. In conclusion, I feel like this project has really helped me improve in my 21st Century Competency skills.
